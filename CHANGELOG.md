  thread (#516, Aaron Kromer)

### 2.10 / 2017-04-21

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.9.2...2.10)

Enhancements:

- Don't restart BLE scanning periodically if the library confrims device can detect duplicate
  advertisements in a single scan, leading to more reliable detections with short scan cycles

Bug Fixes:

- Fixes spurious entry/exit events on Android N caused by OS imposed limits of
  5 scans every 30 seconds. (#419, David G. Young)


### 2.9 / 2016-07-25

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.8.1...2.9)

Enhancements:

- Multiple ranging and monitoring notifiers are supported via
  `BeaconManger#addRangeNotifier(RangeNotifier notifier)` and
  `BeaconManger#addMonitorNotifier(MonitorNotifier notifier)` (#392, ost-ct)
- App bootstrap regions by be dynamically changed with
  new`RegionBootstrap#removeRegion(Region region)` and
  `RegionBootstrap#addRegion(Region region)` methods. (#369, Aristide)
- Improved region state behavior by adding
  `BeaconManager#requestStateForRegion(Region)` and
  `BeaconManager#setRegionStatePeristenceEnabled(boolean)` (#405, David G.
  Young)
- Added a guaranteed callback to
  `MonitorNotifier#didDetermineStateForRegion(int state, Region region)` when
  starting monitoring.  At app startup, this returns the previously known
  persisted state. (#405, David G. Young)
- Custom distance calculation for Moto X 2nd gen XT1092 (#386, Clément Garcia)
- More flexible support for combining multi-frame beacons with
  `Beacon#getExtraDataFields()` (#387, mfatiga)

Bug Fixes:

  adding missing service UUID PDU. (#401, David G. Young)
- Beacon data fields of over four bytes are now be parsed correctly. (#373,
  Junsung Lim)
- Region persistence app freezes resolved by limiting persisted regions to 50
  (#405, David G. Young)
- Fixed inability to starting monitoring for a different Region definition with
  the same uniqueId (#405, David G. Young)
- Fixes Eddystone-URL layout to support the full 17 bytes for URLs (uses 18
  bytes total: 1 byte for schema and 17 bytes for URL) (#377, Mario Pucci)
- Fix potential context leak in `BeaconManager` (#381, Ovidiu Latcu)


### 2.8.1 / 2016-04-18

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.8...2.8.1)

Bug Fixes:

- As of the 2.8 release, scanning would never start on Android 4.x devices
  unless the application manually added ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or
  ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permissions to the AndroidManifest.xml. This fix makes
  it so this is not required for 4.x devices, as was the case prior to 2.8.
  (#365, David G. Young)


### 2.8 / 2016-03-28

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.7.1...2.8)

Enhancements:

- Retains monitored regions across service restarts, preventing apps from
  getting multiple region entry callbacks each time the service restarts.
  (#315, Mateusz Sarzyński)
- Add string identifier to BeaconParser which can be referenced by decoded
  Beacon object, allowing easy determination of beacon type. (#333, David G.
  Young)
- Switch to using ELAPSED_REALTIME clocks, so scanning doesn't stop on devices
  without a battery-backed RTC (#339, Luca Niccoli)
- Add ability to access raw EDDYSTONE_TLM data for sending info to Google
  services. (#328, David G. Young)
- New distance formula for Moto X Pro (#330, David G. Young)
- Adjust the BackgroundPowerSaver so it accepts any context (#355, Kristof
  Snyers)
- Add support for pre-Eddystone UriBeacon layout (#358, David G. Young)

Bug Fixes:

- Multiple consumers of the BeaconService will now each get a
  onBeaconServiceConnected() callback. (#340, Mateusz Sarzyński)
- Don't scan for bluetooth devices if permission has not been granted in
  Android 6. This prevents large number of exceptions in the log. (#327, Alex
  Urzhumtcev)
- Fix crash on beacon parsing comparison overrun (#324, David G. Young)


### 2.7.1 / 2015-11-17

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.7...2.7.1)

Bug Fixes:

- Stopping and starting monitoring disables scans (#317, David G. Young)


### 2.7 / 2015-11-12

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.6.1...2.7)

Enhancements:

- Adds hardware accelerated detection of Eddystone frames in the background on
  Android 5+ (#314, David G. Young)
- Provides ability to forward BLE scan callbacks for non-beacon advertisements
  (#267, Paul Peavyhouse)

Bug Fixes:

- Fix rescheduling of alarms in the distant future so they don't inadvertently
  go off right away (#312, Mateusz Sarzyński)
- Only request `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission on Android M (#296, Henning
  Dodenhof)


### 2.6.1 / 2015-09-30

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.6...2.6.1)

Bug Fixes:

- Allow Regions to match beacons with fewer identifiers if the extra region
  identifiers are null. This allows matching Eddystone-UID and Eddystone-URL
  beacon with the default Region with three null identifiers. This started
  failing in version 2.6. (#295, David G. Young)
- Declare the `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permission in the manifest since it is
  required for Android 6.0. This is helpful to keep beacon detection working on
  Android 6.0 for apps that don't explicitly declare this in their own
  manifest. (#295, David G. Young)


### 2.6 / 2015-09-29

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/AltBeacon/android-beacon-library/compare/2.5.1...2.6)

Enhancements:

- Make region exit period configuration with a default of ten seconds (#283,
  Alex Urzhumtcev)
- When scanning in Background on Android 5+, do a full scan without filters
  during the main scan period (default for 10 seconds once every 5 minutes) in
  case scan filters are unavailable (#293, David G. Young)
- Common open-source BeaconParser layouts are defined as constants on
  BeaconParser (Commit 0101970010, David G. Young)
- Bluetooth address is now a field on Region, offering the option of monitoring
  and ranging for all beacon transmissions from a known device's MAC Address
  (#254, David G. Young)
- Target SDK bumped to 23 for Android 6.0 (#293, David G. Young)

Bug Fixes:

- Fix potential `ConcurrentModificationException` with distance calculation
  (#245, Dawid Drozd)
- Fix potential `NullPointerException` in `Beacon#hashCode` (#249, Sam Yang)
- Switch BeaconParsers list to be a `CopyOnWriteArrayList` to avoid
  `UnsupportedOperationException` changing list after starting scanning. (#290,
  Matthew Michihara)
- Fix crash when region has more identifiers than beacon (#252, David G. Young)
- Fix bugs with compressing Eddystone-URL to bytes and back (#263, Michael
  Harper)
